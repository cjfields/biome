=head1 Boolean Methods

These methods return true or false. They throw an error if start and
end are not defined.

  $range->overlaps($otherRange) && print "Ranges overlap\n";

=head2 overlaps

  Title   : overlaps
  Usage   : if($r1->overlaps($r2)) { do stuff }
  Function: tests if $r2 overlaps $r1
  Args    : arg #1 = a range to compare this one to (mandatory)
            arg #2 = optional strand-testing arg ('strong', 'weak', 'ignore')
  Returns : true if the ranges overlap, false otherwise

=cut

=head2 contains

  Title   : contains
  Usage   : if($r1->contains($r2) { do stuff }
  Function: tests whether $r1 totally contains $r2
  Args    : arg #1 = a range to compare this one to (mandatory)
                 alternatively, integer scalar to test
            arg #2 = optional strand-testing arg ('strong', 'weak', 'ignore')
  Returns : true if the argument is totally contained within this range

=cut

=head2 equals

  Title   : equals
  Usage   : if($r1->equals($r2))
  Function: test whether $r1 has the same start, end, length as $r2
  Args    : arg #1 = a range to compare this one to (mandatory)
            arg #2 = optional strand-testing arg ('strong', 'weak', 'ignore')
  Returns : true if they are describing the same range

=cut

=head1 Geometrical methods

These methods do things to the geometry of ranges, and return
Bio::RangeI compliant objects or triplets (start, stop, strand) from
which new ranges could be built.

=head2 intersection

 Title   : intersection
 Usage   : ($start, $stop, $strand) = $r1->intersection($r2); OR
           ($start, $stop, $strand) = Bio::Range->intersection(\@ranges); OR
           my $containing_range = $r1->intersection($r2); OR
           my $containing_range = Bio::Range->intersection(\@ranges);
 Function: gives the range that is contained by all ranges
 Returns : undef if they do not overlap, or
           the range that they do overlap (in the form of an object
            like the calling one, OR a three element array)
 Args    : arg #1 = [REQUIRED] a range to compare this one to,
                    or an array ref of ranges
           arg #2 = optional strand-testing arg ('strong', 'weak', 'ignore')

=cut

=head2 union

   Title   : union
    Usage   : ($start, $stop, $strand) = $r1->union($r2);
            : ($start, $stop, $strand) = Bio::Range->union(@ranges);
              my $newrange = Bio::Range->union(@ranges);
    Function: finds the minimal Range that contains all of the Ranges
    Args    : a Range or list of Range objects
    Returns : the range containing all of the range
              (in the form of an object like the calling one, OR
              a three element array)

=cut

=head2 overlap_extent

 Title   : overlap_extent
 Usage   : ($a_unique,$common,$b_unique) = $a->overlap_extent($b)
 Function: Provides actual amount of overlap between two different
           ranges
 Example :
 Returns : array of values containing the length unique to the calling
           range, the length common to both, and the length unique to
           the argument range
 Args    : a range

=cut

=head2 disconnected_ranges

    Title   : disconnected_ranges
    Usage   : my @disc_ranges = Bio::Range->disconnected_ranges(@ranges);
    Function: finds the minimal set of ranges such that each input range
              is fully contained by at least one output range, and none of
              the output ranges overlap
    Args    : a list of ranges
    Returns : a list of objects of the same type as the input
              (conforms to RangeI)

=cut

=head2 offsetStranded

    Title    : offsetStranded
    Usage    : $rnge->ofsetStranded($fiveprime_offset, $threeprime_offset)
    Function : destructively modifies RangeI implementing object to
               offset its start and stop coordinates by values $fiveprime_offset and
               $threeprime_offset (positive values being in the strand direction).
    Args     : two integer offsets: $fiveprime_offset and $threeprime_offset
    Returns  : $self, offset accordingly.

=cut

=head2 subtract

  Title   : subtract
  Usage   : my @subtracted = $r1->subtract($r2)
  Function: Subtract range r2 from range r1
  Args    : arg #1 = a range to subtract from this one (mandatory)
            arg #2 = strand option ('strong', 'weak', 'ignore') (optional)
  Returns : undef if they do not overlap or r2 contains this RangeI,
            or an arrayref of Range objects (this is an array since some
            instances where the subtract range is enclosed within this range
            will result in the creation of two new disjoint ranges)
