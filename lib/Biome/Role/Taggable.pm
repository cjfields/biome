=head1 NAME

Biome::Role::Taggable - Role for collecting simple tag-value pairs

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to Biome::Role::Taggable version 0.01.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package MyCollection;
    use Biome;
    with 'Biome::Role::Taggable';

    # and later in main...

    my $tc = MyCollection->new();

    # add 'bar', 'baz' values to 'foo' tag
    $tc->add_tag_values('foo', 'bar', 'baz');

    # retrieves tag names
    say $tc->get_all_tags;                         # 'foo'

    # retrieve values for a specific tag
    say join(',',sort $tc->get_tag_values('foo')); # 'bar,baz';


    # deletes all values for a tag(key)
    $tc->remove_tag('values');
    # check tags (predicate)
    $tc->has_tag('values');     # undef

    # replace tag values
    $tc->set_tag_values('foo', (1,2));
    say join(',',sort $tc->get_tag_values('foo')); # '1,2'

    $tc->add_tag_values('foo', qw(3 4));
    say join(',',sort $tc->get_tag_values('foo')); # '1,2,3,4'
