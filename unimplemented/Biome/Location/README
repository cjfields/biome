=head1 Locations in BioPerl

It is difficult to discuss what we mean by 'locations' without also briefly
mentioning sequence features. The current BioPerl implementation splits all
sequence annotations found in a sequence record into two general groups: those
that pertain to the sequence as a whole (thus implementing
Bio::AnnotationI), and those that are isolated to particular regions, or
'locations', of a sequence (thus implementing {{PM|Bio::SeqFeatureI}}). A group
of classes ('''Bio::Location''') was devised in order to describe simple
locations in a generic way. 

=head2 How location data is handled in BioPerl

{{PM|Bio::Factory::FTLocationFactory}}

Where does <tt>gap</tt> fit in here (found in CONTIG files), or do we plan on supporting it?

==Coordinates==

Definition of start/end coordinates, coordinate policies, etc.

=Types of Locations=

The following all implement {{PM|Bio::LocationI}}.

==Simple==

{{PM|Bio::Location::Atomic}}

{{PM|Bio::Location::Simple}}

==Fuzzy==

{{PM|Bio::Location::Fuzzy}}

===Deprecated fuzzy location types===

==Split==

At this time, all split locations are handled by one class ({{PM|Bio::Location::Split}}), which implements methods from {{PM|Bio::Location::SplitLocationI}} and {{PM|Bio::LocationI}}.  

===<tt>join(location,location, ... location)</tt>===

The indicated elements should be joined (placed end-to-end) to form one contiguous sequence.  Far and away the most common split location type.  Use of this operator implies that the locations are meant to be joined together in the order listed.

There are some ambiguities in the way this location type is handled in BioPerl, particularly re: circular sequences where the location is split across the origin.

NCBI and EBI currently use differing but syntactically similar versions of a split location string on the complement strand.

===<tt>order(location,location, ... location)</tt>===

The elements can be found in the specified order (5' to 3' direction), but nothing is implied about the reasonableness about joining them.

Not as commonly used, but necessary to describe the locations of features like repeated sequences, etc.  Note that one might think you could assign a strand for the split location object, you are allowed to have different strands for the sublocations using this operator.

===<tt>bond(location,location...location)</tt>===

Found in protein files.  These generally are used to describe disulfide bonds.  Some of these location types imply that the order of the location is important (see the example below for 1XDA_D).  

Note that this split location type is not described in the GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ Feature Table definition, presumably because it pertains to protein sequences, not nucleotide sequences.

===Deprecated split locations===

The following split location operators were in GenBank releases prior to rel. 122 and older EMBL releases, but have long since been removed.  They are not supported in BioPerl.

====<tt>group</tt>====

 group(location, location, .. location): The elements are related and
 should be grouped together, but no order is implied.

This differs from <tt>order</tt> in that there is no 5'->3' order of the sublocations.  

====<tt>one-of</tt>====

 one-of(location, location, .. location): The element can be any one,
 but only one, of the items listed.

These elements were used at one point for describing split locations where the exact position of one sublocation was uncertain but could be picked from a group.  These were mainly encountered with genes that were alternatively spliced but were also used for describing variation data.  Now the individually spliced genes are described in separate sequence features, using regular <tt>join</tt> or <tt>order</tt> operators.

Of note, there are still a few of these sequences in GenBank: accession
[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/viewer.fcgi?db=nucleotide&val=ATU39449 ATU39449] is an example (at least for the time being).  One might also encounter these in the annotation COMMENTS section:
