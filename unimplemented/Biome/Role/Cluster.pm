=head1 NAME

Biome::Role::Cluster - Simple role for defining a cluster or grouping of
objects.

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to Biome::Role::Cluster version 0.01.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Biome::Role::Cluster;
   # Brief but working code example(s) here showing the most common usage(s)

   # This section will be as far as many users bother reading,

   # so make it as educational and exemplary as possible.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a simple abstract role that defines what is the minimum expected of
consuming classes that wish to group objects based on specified properties.

Though not required, implementations are encouraged to have a lazy or memory-
efficient way for accessing instance data, for instance using a remote/local
database or using iteration. With this in mind, the default role methods simply
store the ID in a hash with a simple Bool as the value. Implementations can
cache/store the member in this hash, but it is up to the implementation to
properly disambiguate between stored instances and the simple default bool
value.

For instance, the method next_Cluster is used to iterate through the various
objects in this Cluster using an optional filter, whereas get_members may be
used to return a specific subset of objects based on object attributes.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

There are no known bugs in this module.

User feedback is an integral part of the evolution of this and other Biome and
BioPerl modules. Send your comments and suggestions preferably to one of the
BioPerl mailing lists. Your participation is much appreciated.

  bioperl-l@bioperl.org                  - General discussion
  http://bioperl.org/wiki/Mailing_lists  - About the mailing lists

Patches are always welcome.

=head2 Support

Please direct usage questions or support issues to the mailing list:

L<bioperl-l@bioperl.org>

rather than to the module maintainer directly. Many experienced and reponsive
experts will be able look at the problem and quickly address it. Please include
a thorough description of the problem with code and data examples if at all
possible.

=head2 Reporting Bugs

Preferrably, Biome bug reports should be reported to the GitHub Issues bug
tracking system:

Bugs can also be reported using the BioPerl bug tracking system, submitted via
the web:
