=head1 NAME

Bio::Location::FuzzyLocationI - Abstract interface of a Location on a Sequence
which has unclear start/end location

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Get a FuzzyLocationI object somehow
    print "Fuzzy FT location string is ", $location->to_FTstring();
    print "location is of the type ", $location->loc_type, "\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This interface encapsulates the necessary methods for representing a
Fuzzy Location, one that does not have clear start and/or end points.
This will initially serve to handle features from Genbank/EMBL feature
tables that are written as 1^100 meaning between bases 1 and 100 or
E<lt>100..300 meaning it starts somewhere before 100.  Advanced
implementations of this interface may be able to handle the necessary
logic of overlaps/intersection/contains/union.  It was constructed to
handle fuzzy locations that can be represented in Genbank/EMBL.
