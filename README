This is an experimental implementation of BioPerl classes in Moose.  It may
(or may not) be used for a future BioPerl 2.0.  Hic sunt dracones!

Note: The name of the distribution may change at some point in the near future. As
(rightfully) pointed out by Robert Buels, Bio::Moose is not the best name as we
don't name distributions on how they are implemented, but on what they do.
However, as Bio is currently taken, we are open to other possibilities.
